# CS50P Problem Set Solutions

This repository is a collection of solutions for the problem sets from the CS50P course offered by Harvard University. The course, available at [cs50.harvard.edu](https://cs50.harvard.edu/), introduces students to the art of programming. These solutions are meant to serve as a reference for students who have completed the problem sets and are looking to compare their work.

## Overview

The CS50 â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python course covers various topics in computer science and programming using the Python language. Each problem set provided in the course focuses on different aspects of programming and problem-solving.

## Problem Sets

The solutions are organized by problem set, each in its respective directory. Here is a list of the problem sets included:

- Problem Set 0: Functions, Variables
- Problem Set 1: Conditionals
- Problem Set 2: Loops
- Problem Set 3: Exceptions
- Problem Set 4: Libraries
- Problem Set 5: Unit Tests
- Problem Set 6: File I/O
- Problem Set 7: Regular Expressions
- Problem Set 8: Object-Oriented Programming
- Final Project

## Installation

To use these solutions, you should have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the latest version.

In addition to Python, some third-party libraries are also used in these solutions. These libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file in the root directory of this repository. You can install all required libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Please ensure that you have pip installed and that you run this command in the same environment where you plan to run the solutions.

## Usage

To run a solution, navigate to the directory of the problem set and execute the Python script. For example:

``` bash
cd "Problem Set 1/hello" 

python hello.py
```

Replace `hello.py` with the specific solution file you wish to run.
