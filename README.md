## Overview

The CS50 â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python course covers various topics in computer science and programming using the Python language. Each problem set provided in the course focuses on different aspects of programming and problem-solving.

## Problem Sets

The solutions are organized by problem set, each in its respective directory. Here is a list of the problem sets included:

- Problem Set 0: Functions, Variables
- Problem Set 1: Conditionals
- Problem Set 2: Loops
- Problem Set 3: Exceptions
- Problem Set 4: Libraries
- Problem Set 5: Unit Tests
- Problem Set 6: File I/O
- Problem Set 7: Regular Expressions
- Problem Set 8: Object-Oriented Programming
- Final Project

## Installation

To use these solutions, you should have Python installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, visit [python.org](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the latest version.

## Usage

To run a solution, navigate to the directory of the problem set and execute the Python script. For example:

``` bash
cd "Problem Set 1/hello" 

python hello.py
```

Replace `hello.py` with the specific solution file you wish to run.
